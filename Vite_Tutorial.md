# Quick Vite Tutorial

## Create a Vite Project:
    npm create vite@latest   OR   the desired version

## Installing dependencies (do this in every new device):
    npm install

This takes the dependencies referenced in package.json and installs them. I already added bootstrap with:
    npm install bootstrap@5.3.3

## Start the app in the server 
    npm run dev
We will use this command every day to start the app in dev mode. We will use **npm run build** and **npm run preview** in the future.

That's all for now
