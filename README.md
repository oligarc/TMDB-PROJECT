# TMDB PROJECT

## Description

This project uses the **TMDB (The Movie Database)** API to display the newest movies and allow custom searches filtered by title  and genre. 
Users also can explore a variety of movies, view details, and browse through specific categories.

Please note that in order to use this project you need to make a free account in TMDB to obtain a key and then make queries, this will be all explained below so don't worry.

## Preview

As you won't be capable of using this unless you first make your account, we think it's a good idea to show you how the app is built.

This is the first thing you'll see when you run the app, the newest films.

Once you are on them, it has a transition to make it more dynamic.

If you click on them, you're being redirected to see more details of the film as you can see

Also, as you can see, you can add it to your favourites or to your watchlist
